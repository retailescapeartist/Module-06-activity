# Module-06-activity
A web application for my favorite things
This site was created for a project using jQuery
Different themes were made using jQuery's Theme Roller, and then implemented in the site's design
Inside the main page there is a summarry, some headers, a navigation link, a few images, a navigation panel for other sites (not working, just examples), and a list below the controller image that takes the user to different sections of the site
